# Documentation

Whenever you changed anything that is documented here, make sure to update the documentation as well.

To do so, simply change the appropriate file in the `docs` folder and make your changes.

To preview them, run `npm run docs:dev`.

This will start a local server that will automatically reload whenever you change a file.


:::info
Do not include compiled documentation in your pull request.  
Our CI will take care of this and automatically generate the documentation when your pull request is merged.
